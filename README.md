# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop and train a 
deep learning model to remove noise from 
high-resolution images of hair. By applying 
various data augmentations and training techniques, 
we aim to improve the visual quality of the images
and make them more suitable for further
processing or analysis.


**Please note that this is a work in progress.**
More details and instructions on how to use the code will be added soon.
